## üìò Introduction

An **Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS)** is a computer-controlled system used in warehouses and manufacturing facilities to automatically place and retrieve loads from predefined storage locations. These systems are designed to increase efficiency, reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and optimize inventory management.

This project demonstrates a **fully simulated ASRS** system created using:
- **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)** for control logic
- **HMI (Human Machine Interface)** for operator interaction
- **Factory I/O** for a realistic 3D simulation of the industrial environment

## üéØ Objective

The main goal of this project is to simulate an **automated warehouse cell system** that performs:
- Loading of pallets to specific storage locations
- Unloading pallets from designated storage cells
- Monitoring and managing system status in real-time
- Visualizing and controlling operations through HMI
- Programming logic for emergency and reset functions

## üè≠ Factory I/O Simulation

| ![Factory I/O Environment](https://github.com/tejascw/Automated-Storage-and-Retrieval-System-ASRS-using-PLC-HMI-Factory-i-o/blob/main/ASRS%202.jpg) |- 3D model of a warehouse with racks, pallets, and conveyor belts.
- Crane SC1 moves pallets from the conveyor to storage cells.
- Crane SC2 retrieves pallets and places them on the output conveyor.
- Integrated via **OPC communication** with the PLC controller.|
| ![Factory I/O Device](https://github.com/tejascw/Automated-Storage-and-Retrieval-System-ASRS-using-PLC-HMI-Factory-i-o/blob/main/ASRS_Factory%20i_o%20Device%20Input_Output%20conections.jpg) |  This image shows the device Input and Output pin connections in Factory I/O.

Inputs (left side ‚Äì Sensors/Buttons):
These are signals acquired from the system, such as sensors, limit switches, and push buttons. They provide real-time feedback to the PLC/Controller. For example:

Emergency Stop

Start/Stop Buttons

Limit switches (Left/Right, Middle, etc.)

Position sensors (Load Sensor, Exit Sensor, Unloading Sensor)

Movement status (SC1 Moving X, SC2 Moving Z, etc.)

Outputs (right side ‚Äì Actuators):
These are control signals sent from the PLC/Controller to actuators that perform physical actions in the system. For example:

SC1 / SC2 Lift SET

Load/Unload Conveyor

Roller Conveyors

Target Position control

Start/Stop Indicator Lights

Middle Section (Server Mapping via MX OPC Configurator):
This shows the OPC server mapping (Mitsubishi MXOPC). Each input and output from Factory I/O is linked to its corresponding PLC tag address. The mapping ensures that sensor feedback (inputs) and actuator commands (outputs) are correctly exchanged between Factory I/O and the PLC.

So in short:

Inputs = acquiring data from sensors & buttons (feedback to PLC).

Outputs = actuating data to actuators (commands from PLC to perform actions).

Middle = OPC mapping layer where Factory I/O signals are connected to PLC addresses. |

## üìã PLC Programming Highlights

[PLC_LADDER_LOGIC_PROGRAMMING](https://github.com/tejascw/Automated-Storage-and-Retrieval-System-ASRS-using-PLC-HMI-Factory-i-o/blob/main/PLC_LADDER_LOGIC_PROGRAMMING.jpg)

The ladder logic was developed using **GX Works3** and exported as an HTML file. Some key sections include:

- **Main Power Switching**
- **Crane SC1 & SC2 Power & Motion Memory**
- **Universal Reset Logic**
- **Emergency Stop Memory**
- **Position Tracking with D-registers (e.g., D8, D9, D5, D6)**
