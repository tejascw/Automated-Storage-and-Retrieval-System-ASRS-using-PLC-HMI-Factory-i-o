## üìò Introduction

An **Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS)** is a computer-controlled system used in warehouses and manufacturing facilities to automatically place and retrieve loads from predefined storage locations. These systems are designed to increase efficiency, reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and optimize inventory management.

This project demonstrates a **fully simulated ASRS** system created using:
- **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)** for control logic
- **HMI (Human Machine Interface)** for operator interaction
- **Factory I/O** for a realistic 3D simulation of the industrial environment

## üß† System Description

- Total of **54 storage cells** available for operation.
- Two cranes:  
  - **SC1** for **Loading**  
  - **SC2** for **Unloading**
- **Sensors and actuators** are monitored via PLC logic.
- HMI screen displays real-time data like:
  - Current loading/unloading cell number
  - Total filled and empty cells
  - Start/Stop/Reset controls
  - Emergency Stop mechanism
- **Error Handling** and **Universal Reset** logic for smooth recovery.

The ladder logic was developed using **GX Works3** and exported as an HTML file. Some key sections include:

- **Main Power Switching**
- **Crane SC1 & SC2 Power & Motion Memory**
- **Universal Reset Logic**
- **Emergency Stop Memory**
- **Position Tracking with D-registers (e.g., D8, D9, D5, D6)**
- **Calculation of filled/empty cells using counters and logic operations**
- **Cell targeting via D100 (SC1) and D200 (SC2)**

## üè≠ Factory I/O Simulation


# Images & Description 


![Factory I/O Environment](https://github.com/tejascw/Automated-Storage-and-Retrieval-System-ASRS-using-PLC-HMI-Factory-i-o/blob/main/ASRS%202.jpg) 

3D model of a warehouse with racks, pallets, and conveyor belts. Crane SC1 moves pallets from the conveyor to storage cells. Crane SC2 retrieves pallets and places them on the output conveyor. Integrated via **OPC communication** with the PLC controller.

![Factory I/O Device](https://github.com/tejascw/Automated-Storage-and-Retrieval-System-ASRS-using-PLC-HMI-Factory-i-o/blob/main/ASRS_Factory%20i_o%20Device%20Input_Output%20conections.jpg) 

This image represents the device input and output pin connections in Factory I/O. On the left side are inputs, which consist of signals acquired from sensors, limit switches, and push buttons that provide real-time feedback to the PLC or controller (e.g., emergency stop, start/stop buttons, load/unload sensors, and movement status like SC1 Moving X or SC2 Moving Z). On the right side are outputs, which are control signals sent from the PLC to actuators that execute physical actions in the system, such as operating SC1/SC2 lifts, controlling load/unload conveyors, roller conveyors, target positioning, or activating indicator lights. The middle section represents the OPC mapping layer, where Factory I/O signals are linked to corresponding PLC tag addresses through the MX OPC Configurator. This mapping ensures proper communication, so that input feedback from the system reaches the PLC and output commands from the PLC drive the actuators. In short, inputs = feedback from the system, outputs = commands to the system, and the middle = the communication bridge via OPC mapping.

## üìå Project Workflow

1. **System Initialization**:
   - Power ON via HMI
   - Cranes powered individually
2. **Loading Process (SC1)**:
   - Pallets picked from input conveyor
   - Stored at targeted cell using D100
   - Filled cell count updated
3. **Unloading Process (SC2)**:
   - Retrieves pallet from cell position D200
   - Places on output conveyor
   - Empty cell count updated
4. **Error/Reset Handling**:
   - System can be reset to initial state via universal reset
   - Emergency stop halts all operations
