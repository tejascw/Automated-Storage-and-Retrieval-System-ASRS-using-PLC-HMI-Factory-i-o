# üì¶ Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) using PLC, HMI & Factory I/O

## üìò Introduction

An **Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS)** is a computer-controlled system used in warehouses and manufacturing facilities to automatically place and retrieve loads from predefined storage locations. These systems are designed to increase efficiency, reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and optimize inventory management.

This project demonstrates a **fully simulated ASRS** system created using:
- **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)** for control logic
- **HMI (Human Machine Interface)** for operator interaction
- **Factory I/O** for a realistic 3D simulation of the industrial environment

## üéØ Objective

The main goal of this project is to simulate an **automated warehouse cell system** that performs:
- Loading of pallets to specific storage locations
- Unloading pallets from designated storage cells
- Monitoring and managing system status in real-time
- Visualizing and controlling operations through HMI
- Programming logic for emergency and reset functions

## üß† System Description

- Total of **54 storage cells** available for operation.
- Two cranes:  
  - **SC1** for **Loading**  
  - **SC2** for **Unloading**
- **Sensors and actuators** are monitored via PLC logic.
- HMI screen displays real-time data like:
  - Current loading/unloading cell number
  - Total filled and empty cells
  - Start/Stop/Reset controls
  - Emergency Stop mechanism
- **Error Handling** and **Universal Reset** logic for smooth recovery.

## üè≠ Factory I/O Simulation

![Factory I/O Environment](https://github.com/tejascw/Automated-Storage-and-Retrieval-System-ASRS-using-PLC-HMI-Factory-i-o/blob/main/ASRS%202.jpg)

- 3D model of a warehouse with racks, pallets, and conveyor belts.
- Crane SC1 moves pallets from the conveyor to storage cells.
- Crane SC2 retrieves pallets and places them on the output conveyor.
- Integrated via **OPC communication** with the PLC controller.

## üìã PLC Programming Highlights

The ladder logic was developed using **GX Works3** and exported as an HTML file. Some key sections include:

- **Main Power Switching**
- **Crane SC1 & SC2 Power & Motion Memory**
- **Universal Reset Logic**
- **Emergency Stop Memory**
- **Position Tracking with D-registers (e.g., D8, D9, D5, D6)**
- **Calculation of filled/empty cells using counters and logic operations**
- **Cell targeting via D100 (SC1) and D200 (SC2)**

## üìå Project Workflow

1. **System Initialization**:
   - Power ON via HMI
   - Cranes powered individually
2. **Loading Process (SC1)**:
   - Pallets picked from input conveyor
   - Stored at targeted cell using D100
   - Filled cell count updated
3. **Unloading Process (SC2)**:
   - Retrieves pallet from cell position D200
   - Places on output conveyor
   - Empty cell count updated
4. **Error/Reset Handling**:
   - System can be reset to initial state via universal reset
   - Emergency stop halts all operations
